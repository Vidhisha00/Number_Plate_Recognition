# Number_Plate_Recognition
Number plate recognition system using simple Python libraries

The identification of a vehicle's license plate holds significant importance within a video surveillance-oriented security system. The extraction of a number plate from an image can be achieved by the application of various computer vision techniques. Subsequently, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) can be employed to accurately identify and recognize the alphanumeric characters comprising the license number.
